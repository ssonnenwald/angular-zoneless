# Angular Zoneless Change Detection Demo App

This is a simple demo application with the Experimental Zoneless Mode enabled in Angular v18. It has a parent and two child components - with four types of data for each component including input, property, signal and observable.

Triggering changes in these four types of data - both synchronously and asynchronously through timeout, shows us pretty clearly the differences the default change detection with Zoneless mode.
